TP1 : implement different symmetric encryption algorithms that use the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message, using Python. The algorithms we will be programming are Caesar's cipher, Vigenère's cipher and Vernam's cipher. We will also look at cryptoanalysis methods to break Caesar's ( Frequency analysis ) and Vigenère's ciphers(Kasiski Test).

TP3 : We will look at the Diffie-Hellman protocol for securely sharing a secret key, the RSA algorithm and its RSA-CRT variant, the AlGammal algorithm.

TP4 : In this section, we will look at two signature algorithms: RSA and its CRT-RSA variant, as well as DSA. We will then look at the elliptic curve.

TP5 : ELLIPTIC CURVE CRYPTOGRAPHY (ECC)

TP6 : blockchain consensus mechanism
